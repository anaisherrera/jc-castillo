<br>The theory of attributions has a long tradition in studying explanations for the origin of poverty. Nevertheless, research regarding the perceived causes of wealth has been so far sidelined and not related to the study of poverty attributions. This paper focuses on the relationship between poverty and wealth attributions from a latent variable measurement perspective, for which it considers two basic attribution types: internal (based on individual behavior) and external (based on socio-structural determinants). The data comes from a 10-indicator scale from the national representative survey “Social Justice and Citizenship Participation”, applied in Chile in 2013 (N=1.245). Based in previous exploratory and confirmatory studies, a factorial confirmatory model for internal and external attributions of both poverty an wealth was estimated (four factors), based on which a second order two-factor confirmatory model was estimated, one for internal and one for external attributions, for both poverty and wealth. The results show for the first time evidence of common attributional dimensions for poverty and wealth
