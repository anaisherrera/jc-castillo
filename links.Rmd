## Software

I use software compatible with the principles of open science, this is, free and open source.

- My operating system is Linux, I use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) with Gnome-[Cairo Dock](http://glx-dock.org/). A lot of freedom for customization  ... and looks great.

- For general statistical analysis and reporting I work in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), using packages for data science from [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

- For more specific analysis I have been using for a while [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) for multilevel models and (Lavaan)[http://lavaan.ugent.be/] for SEM.
- I also use R's reproducibility tools as [Knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) & Rmarkdown ... before I used to be a fan of Latex, but the simplicity and efficiency of Markdown is unbeatable, even for presentations with tools such as [remark](https://remarkjs.com/) & [Xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/) .
- For writing and most of my work I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) . I am currently working in a workflow for academic writing linking Atom, R, Bibtex and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) via [BetterBibTex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex). So far it is working, a draft (in spanish) is [here](https://juancarloscastillo.github.io/citando-plano/)
