### Tutorials

- [Citando en texto plano](citando-plano.html) (citing in plain text): referencias bibliográficas para documentos académicos en LaTeX, (R)Markdown, y Xaringan desde Atom.  
<br/>

### Software

I use software compatible with the principles of open science, this is, free and open source.

- My operating system is Linux, I use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) with Gnome-[Cairo Dock](http://glx-dock.org/). A lot of freedom for customization  ... and looks great.

- For general statistical analysis and reporting I work in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), using packages for data science from [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

- For more specific analysis: I use [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) for multilevel models and [Lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) for SEM.

- I also use R's reproducibility tools as [Knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) & Rmarkdown ... before I used to be a fan of LaTeX, but the simplicity and efficiency of Markdown seems unbeatable, even for presentations with tools such as [remark](https://remarkjs.com/) & [Xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/) .

- For writing (and almost for everything so far) I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor. Just great, and smooth with Git/Github.
